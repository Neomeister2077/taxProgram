# Tax Calculator

This project is comprised of 2 scripts which use regex to search through given PDFs to find amounts paid into an account and then adds up all the payments to give a total, its main purpose is to calculate tax. taxProgram.py searches invoices in the directory it is pointed to and bankStatementChecker.py does what it says on the tin. 

## Geting Started

To run the program you only need python to be installed on your machine 

### Prerequisites
You need to create a folder where the bank statements / invoices will be kept and add that folder directory to the "path" variable at the beginning of each script.
