# Tax Calculator

This project is comprised of 2 scripts which use regex to search through given PDFs to find amounts paid into an account and then adds up all the payments to give a total, its main purpose is to calculate tax. taxProgram.py searches invoices in the directory it is pointed to and bankStatementChecker.py does what it says on the tin.
